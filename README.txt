Welcome to the Rock, Paper, Scissors Tournament. This website was inspired by an Instagram post that I saw one night.

The premise is to ask the user for a number that is divisible by 3 (might even add a slider) which I will refer to as n. 
n/3 instances of rock, paper and scissors blocks are then created, added to the canvas and given random velocities. 

The blocks are free to collide with each other and the borders of the canvas, but it follows the conventional rules of 
rock, paper and scissors. If a rock block hits the scissor block, the scissor block turns into a rock. If a scissor block
hits a paper block, the paper block becomes scissors. Whichever block is the last one standing is the winner of the
tournament!

I am slowly adding updates to the website, adding changes as I see fit, but I'm always open to hearing what suggestions
other people might have. I'll be providing my contact information on the website in case anyone wants to reach out.
In the meantime, I hope you enjoy the website!
